# Projects
- My first project learning pytorch is a CNN that identifies a number.jpg between 0 and 9 (MNIST database). The notebook with the results, code and comments is named "IdentifyingNumbers.ipynb". The comments are in portuguese(BR). 
- The model is available as "Modelo(1).pt" inside the folder "Identifying Numbers"
- Hope you enjoy :)
